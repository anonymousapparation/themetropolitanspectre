        <h1>The Lurker in the Dark #109</h1>
        <h3>Danger Scale: 4/5</h3>
        <img src="https://anonymousapparation.github.io/themetropolitanspectre/images/unnamed.png" alt="Header Image">
        <p>Many businessmen have noticed strange activity in the parking garage of the Industrial District. Some have reported sightings of a hideous entity which dwells only in dark corners. These witnesses have noticed the ghoul’s intense aversion to any sources of light, preferring the deepest levels of the garage, where few frequent. Historian Jacques Rosencrantz suspects that this creature may be a member of the Rockhold catastrophe victims. In 1878, workers building a system of underground waterworks became stranded below when a cement truck crashed and sealed the entrance. With no light in their new home, it is rumored that they evolved, becoming both blind and monstrous.</p>

        <h3>Danger Scale: 3/5</h3>
        <img src="https://anonymousapparation.github.io/themetropolitanspectre/images/unnamed.png" alt="Header Image">
        <p>The city’s museum of art has seen nearly 10 security guards quit their jobs in the past year. Though the reason for this may seem puzzling, their testimony points to the presence of a ghost. A former guard tearfully explained his frightening encounter with a tall man in a black tuxedo. He witnessed the man crawl out of a painting from which he belonged to. The portrait features detailed black eyes, behind which a sinister expression peers. The man has long hair and an outgrown mustache. Historian Jacques Rosencrantz has scoured his library for clues as to who this might be, but has only found a small lead. It was written that a man known as L. B. was awestruck at the extreme similarity his portrait bore to him. His servants brushed off his complaints that the portrait spoke, but were ultimately shocked when he was found missing, having been last seen in his study. By the way, when you’re there, I’m also a big fan of surge. It’s this dope artwork on the bottom floor that I would love a picture of. Upload that under number 999 for misc.</p>

        <h1>Johannes, The Reader. #078</h1>
        <h3>Danger Scale: 2/5</h3>
        <img src="https://anonymousapparation.github.io/themetropolitanspectre/images/unnamed.png" alt="Header Image">
        <p>Citizens have reported sightings of an elderly ghost, seemingly reading a newspaper in the Leisure District. According to historian Jacques Rosencrantz, this ghost may correspond to the case of Johannes, The Reader, from 1927. This man often sat on his favorite bench, which overlooked “La Grande Fontaine du Pruneau”. The public said that he always appeared to be searching for a particular headline, which never seemed to show up. One day, however, Johannes took one look at his newspaper and died of a heart attack, falling twenty feet to the ground. The newspaper unfurled, and was opened to the deceased column. It can be presumed that the awful news which he was met with caused his soul to remain, waiting on that iron bench.</p>

        <h1>The Train Whistle #295</h1>
        <h3>Danger Scale: 5/5</h3>
        <img src="https://anonymousapparation.github.io/themetropolitanspectre/images/unnamed.png" alt="Header Image">
        <p>Railroad conductor Dale Hamlin detailed his experience from Arkham hospital, which constitutes the only confirmed sighting of Entity 295. He was incredibly startled to hear a train whistle echoe out in the night. Imagining that another train had somehow become stalled on the tracks, he frantically slowed his engine in response to the perceived warning. However, there was no train to be seen, as his locomotive crawled to a stop. Soon, however, a piercing whistle rang out from directly in front of him. Looking closely, he glimpsed a creature in the shadows which leaped at him. It is speculated by actions expert Matteo Blue that this entity imitated the sound of a train to lure Hamlin. Based on the sole available photograph, the creature’s facial anatomy might allow it to make this high pierced whistle. From Arkham hospital, Hamlin is now being treated for a lost limb. Matteo Blue warns of the extreme danger presented by this entity, and suggests that all media personnel stay off the tracks, observing from a distance.</p>

        <h1>The Mirlitons #022</h1>
        <h3>Danger Scale: 2/5</h3>
        <img src="https://anonymousapparation.github.io/themetropolitanspectre/images/unnamed.png" alt="Header Image">
        <p>For long an elusive race of tiny creatures have been hinted at in fairytales, says Jacques Rosencrantz. Known as The Mirlitons, they are the culprit of most grave robberies, though they are seldom caught. In the waning hours of day, the Mirlitons ransack old graveyards, taking valuable items, which they then trade amongst themselves. Action expert Matteo Blue warns that no one has yet discovered where they live, though it is rumored to be in underground hovels. On account of this, one’s best chance at photographing these creatures is in the act of graverobbing. Blue has intercepted intel that a troop of them have set out for a graveyard on the city outskirts.\n\n\n</p>

        <p>No photographs of this entity have surfaced, resulting in very sparse intel. Some contest that Anonymous is not even a ghost at all. This figure has been at the forefront of many hacking scandals, and is a master hacker. </p>
